# SLINK Leveling Service Cloudflare Worker

SLINK means **Shared Live Intelligence NetworK**. This directory contains the
versioned source for the SLINK Leveling Service API Worker. It contains no
deployment credentials or member API keys.

## Release identification

Every deployable source change updates `WORKER_VERSION` near the top of
`worker.js`. The root route, health route, and every response header expose that
version. The current release is identified as
`0.13.4-permissions-client-scheduling`. It combines the read-optimized client
scheduling protocol with the standalone permissions database.

## Cloudflare configuration

The Worker expects:

- `DB`: the existing D1 database;
- `CONSENT_DB`: the separate append-only SLINK terms acceptance database;
- `PERMISSIONS_DB`: the standalone `slink-permissions` D1 database described in
  [`../../SLINK-Permissions`](../../SLINK-Permissions/README.md);
- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: the secret protecting `/api/admin/*`;
- `SESSION_SECRET`: the secret signing individual 12-hour member sessions;
- `FFSCOUTER_API_KEY`: the operator-owned key used only by scheduled
  FFScouter leveling discovery.

The discovery filter uses three optional, non-secret Worker variables:

- `FFSCOUTER_LEVELING_MIN_LEVEL` (default `30`);
- `FFSCOUTER_LEVELING_MAX_LEVEL` (default `100`);
- `FFSCOUTER_LEVELING_MAX_STATS` (default `2000`).

Keep all secrets in Cloudflare and out of this repository.

## Required versioned consent

The full SLINK API & Data Terms are published in versioned folders under
[`../terms`](../terms/README.md). The current August 23, 2026 release is consent
version `2026-08-23` and includes the paid-product access model.

Authentication fails closed unless the request explicitly accepts the current
version. The Worker performs this check before contacting Torn. After Torn
returns the user's identity and current faction, the Worker resolves active
`slink.level` grants from `PERMISSIONS_DB`, writes one permanent acceptance row
for that Torn user, terms version, service, and disclosure version to
`CONSENT_DB`, and only then issues the session. Re-authentication to the same versions uses
the existing row without overwriting its original timestamp. Future overall
terms or Leveling-disclosure versions create another row, and sessions carrying
older versions stop authenticating.

The ledger stores the Torn user and faction IDs, terms version, document URL and
SHA-256 fingerprint, service/disclosure identity and fingerprint, first
acceptance time, client identity/version, and the explicit-checkbox method. It
does not store the Torn API key, IP address, or browser user-agent. The Worker
has no update or deletion path for acceptance records, and database triggers
reject accidental updates or deletions.

## Product access and permissions

Current Slinky's faction members receive `slink.level` from the faction grant
for faction `46978`. A nonmember must have an active direct `slink.level` grant,
normally from a purchase or a manual assignment. Future grants, expired grants,
and revoked grants do not authorize a session. When the effective Leveling
grant expires in less than 12 hours, the signed session expires at that same
time instead of outliving the purchase.

`admin.*` is reserved for Considious, Torn user `3853023`. The Worker filters
that scope from every other user's resolved grants even if an erroneous D1 row
exists. Normal Leveling routes require `slink.level`; signed admin sessions may
also access `/api/admin/*`, while the existing `X-Admin-Token` remains available
for operator automation.

Permissions are read during authentication and embedded in the signed session.
Routine recommendation and collection requests therefore do not query the
permissions database on every poll. Revoked or changed grants take effect on
the next authentication; existing sessions remain bounded by their signed
expiration, with a maximum lifetime of 12 hours.

## Data ownership

D1 stores shared service facts: targets, status observations, hospital events,
scheduling, activity exclusions, stable recommendation assignments, and
per-user collector leases. Scheduled check assignments are calculated without
creating per-target claim rows.

Personalized Fair Fight is not a shared service fact. The userscript reads the member's own
battle stats from Torn once per day and stores only a local score and total in
Tampermonkey. It immediately estimates Fair Fight from that score and the
master target estimate. Exact member battle stats and Fair Fight values are not
uploaded or stored in D1.

The scheduled leveling-catalog collector makes one randomized, inactive-target
FFScouter request per Cron Trigger. By default, it stores only level 30-100
candidates with an absolute battle-stat estimate of 2,000 or less in the
existing `targets` table. Those three bounds are ordinary Worker variables, so
they can be expanded without editing or redeploying the source. The collector
ignores personalized Fair Fight, writes no search history, and uses a
conditional upsert so unchanged candidates consume no additional D1 row
writes. The operator key remains a Cloudflare secret and is never returned by a
route.

The browser sends only a temporary minimum and maximum target-stat range with
the recommendation request. The Worker uses that range for assignment without
persisting it. FFScouter then refines displayed values in one background batch,
and those results remain in local browser storage for seven days.

The old authenticated `POST /api/fair-fight` route remains temporarily as a
no-op for compatibility with an older client. It does not write anything.

## Multi-device coordination

`GET /api/recommendations` elects or renews the active collector while returning
the target list. This avoids a separate heartbeat request. One signed session
per Torn user receives routine Torn API work, while other sessions remain
standby. The normal client interval defaults to 300 seconds and remains
configurable from 60 to 300 seconds.

The collector lease is twice the calling client's configured interval. At the
300-second default, another device can take over after roughly two missed loads,
or ten minutes. At a 90-second interval, failover takes roughly three minutes.
Expired rows are replaced or cleaned up by the next request. They do not run
background work while every device is offline.

Recommendation leases are keyed by Torn user ID and remain stable for the
12-hour member session, so a user's PC and mobile sessions see the same target
set. They are replaced early only when a target becomes invalid for that list,
and released after that user has no live collector device.
Collector ownership is keyed by signed session ID, allowing another device to
take over after the collector lease expires.

Scheduled checks are shared by active Torn user, not by device. The Worker reads
one bounded target-state snapshot and returns the same active-collector roster
and scheduling bucket to each elected collector. Each client then applies the
same due-time rules, recommendation priority, and rendezvous hash, producing
disjoint assignments without another Worker request or per-target claim rows in
D1. PC and mobile sessions for one Torn user still consume one collector share,
because only that user's elected session participates.

Recommendation ranking is source-neutral. Baldr, Legacy, Extra, and every other
source label are metadata only and never boost or penalize a target. The
member's locally derived stat range removes obvious strength mismatches before
assignment. Inside that range, the Worker favors low competition, useful target
level, lower estimated target stats, and targets that are not already leased to
another member. This gives different members their own lists whenever the
available pool permits it.

Scoped routes use `Authorization: Bearer <session token>`. Admin routes accept

The client derives its interval capacity from Considious Torn Core Lib's shared
60-per-minute allowance. At the five-minute default it can accept up to 300
checks. It computes the due set and its deterministic share from the Worker's
snapshot, then spaces those checks across the interval. Every Torn request still
passes through Core Lib, so other installed scripts remain part of the same rate
limit. Observation uploads use up to 200 rows per Worker request to avoid
unnecessary invocations.

Only the `admin.*` session may set its routine API contribution capacity to
zero. All other users must contribute through the normal Core Lib-controlled
allowance; the Worker rejects a zero-capacity claim even if a client bypasses
the GUI restriction.

Release 0.11.0 also handles each observation upload as bounded D1 batches.
Targets, prior statuses, and seven-day hospital history are preloaded in groups;
status and hospital changes are then written with multi-row statements. Routine
`Okay` and `Unknown` results no longer issue no-op recommendation-lease deletes.
The maximum 200-observation upload is sized to use no more than 44 D1 statements,
including the worst case where every row creates a hospital event and releases a
lease.

The snapshot marks targets currently assigned in a recommendation list. Clients
sort those targets behind unassigned work when creating Torn API check plans.
Opening an assigned target through the panel starts the userscript in that attack
tab; visible status and hospital time are submitted as an attack-page observation
and enter the same shared state. Assigned targets remain a fallback for API
checks if no unassigned due work is available.

## Migrations

Migrations 0001 and 0002 created the original coordination tables. Release
0.10.0 stops using `client_check_claims`, but leaves the legacy table in place
so this Worker update requires no destructive database migration. Migration
0003 only removes the unused experimental `user_target_fair_fight` table if it
was manually created while 0.5.0 was being developed.

Release 0.11.0 changes only how observation queries are grouped. It uses the
existing schema and requires no migration.

The separate consent database uses
`consent-database/0001-terms-acceptances.sql`. Run that schema only against the
consent database, then bind it to the Worker as `CONSENT_DB`. It is intentionally
not numbered as a migration for the main target database.

The standalone permissions database uses
[`../../SLINK-Permissions/migrations/0001-permissions.sql`](../../SLINK-Permissions/migrations/0001-permissions.sql).
Bind that database as `PERMISSIONS_DB`. It is intentionally separate from the
Leveling target database so future SLINK products can use the same grants
without routing through Leveling.

## Test

runner and covers auth/session protection, bounded observation query counts,
low-write coordination, scheduling, activity, personal target-stat ranges,
source-neutral ranking, unique target leasing,
local-only Fair Fight estimates, collector failover, fair check sharing,
interval pacing, fail-closed versioned consent, append-only acceptance records,
old-session invalidation, centralized grants, purchase-expiry capping,
admin-only zero contribution, parsing, and CORS.
